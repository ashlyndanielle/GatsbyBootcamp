      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>In the spring of 2017, I started looking into the world of web development and was immediately hooked. The combination of logic and creativity, endless opportunities to learn and grow, and ability to easily work from anywhere in the world pulled me in. It was love at first function. I started working at Sundance Institute that fall and I've strived to advance my skills everyday. I'm passionate and self driven, dedicated and determined, curious and resourceful, and a committed member of my team!</p>
